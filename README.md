# Robotic-Arm
This was one of my first projects, which led me to fall in love with computer software and hardware. In the creation of the robotic arm, I used an Arduino UNO and multiple micro servos to create movement in the base, claw, and arm. I also redesigned the parts on AutoCAD to make them more cost efficient to 3D print. After all the parts were ready, I assembled them and made modifications to the code as required. Overall, the project was a success and the robotic arm was able to lift small objects!

Unfortunately, the code was lost and pictures of the robotic arm were not taken at the time of creation.
